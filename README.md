## Concept
  You take the role of a king overseeing their kingdom's economy, resources, and army. Hire underlings, fund expeditions and face the might of the orc legion. Idle Throne is a combination of an idle progression game with RPG elements including bosses, an inventory and loot system, and user battles.

  This project is in early development and released only as a proof of concept repository. Assets like images are currently not included and you'll need to provide your own.
